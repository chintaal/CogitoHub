Cogito means to Think, and this platform is aimed to be a hub for thinking, collaborative platform for thinkers. Thinking is what makes us humans, the cognitive revolution is when we moved on from being animals, now there is a second cognitive revolution taking place, at this moment and we want to aid it as best as we can.
